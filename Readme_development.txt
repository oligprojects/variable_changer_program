Created by Oliver Greaneys team GMIT

Developemnt blog
Initially we discussed the program we wanted to build then set up git accounts.
we split up the work load. First task was to develop a gui sketch so we would
have a template to work with.
Out of the 3 gui sketches we decided on the best and went with that.

next we developed the code.
Oliver Greaney: Setup git online. Developed program code.
Declan Flaherty: Developed Mig layout, expanded upon original Mig design and tested finished product.
Shane Dooley: Combined main program with the mig layout gui. Tested program and checked for runtime errors.
